    "Summarization can take two forms:\n",
    "- **`Extractice`** - Selecting representations piece of text\n",
    "- **`Abstractive`** - Generating new text (i.e. novel) summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use a model which does *abstractive* summarization.\n",

    "In this section, we will use:\n",
    "- **Data**: [xsum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum) dataset, which provides a set of BBC articles and summaries.\n",
    "- **Model**: [t5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small) model, which has 60 million parameters (242MB for PyTorch).  T5 is an encoder-decoder model created by Google which supports several tasks such as summarization, translation, Q&A, and text classification.  For more details, see the [Google blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html), [code on GitHub](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer), or the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).\n",

      "Gundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in \"weeks\" rather than months.\n",

      "And Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.\n",

    "Sentiment analysis is a text classification task of estimating whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or another \"sentiment\" label.  The precise set of sentiment labels can vary across applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this section, we will use:\n",
    "- **Data**: [poem sentiment](https://huggingface.co/datasets/poem_sentiment) dataset, which provides lines from poems tagged with sentiments `negative` (0), `positive` (1), `no_impact` (2), or `mixed` (3).\n",
    "- **Model**: [fine-tuned version of BERT](https://huggingface.co/nickwong64/bert-base-uncased-poems-sentiment).  BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is an encoder-only model from Google usable for 11+ tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition.  For more details, see this [Hugging Face blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/bert-101) or the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_&#40;language_model&#41;).\n",

For more details, see the [Google blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html), [code on GitHub](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer), or the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).

    "\n",
    "To do this search, LLMs use one of two main methods:\n",
    "* **Search**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next most likely token in a \"search.\"\n",
    "   * **Greedy search** (default): Pick the single next most likely token in a greedy search.\n",
    "   * **Beam search**: Greedy search can be extended via beam search, which searches down several sequence paths, via the parameter `num_beams`.\n",
    "* **Sampling**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next token by sampling from the predicted distribution of tokens.\n",
    "   * **Top-k sampling**: The parameter `top_k` modifies sampling by limiting it to the `k` most likely tokens.\n",
    "   * **Top-p sampling**: The parameter `top_p` modifies sampling by limiting it to the most likely tokens up to probability mass `p`.\n",
